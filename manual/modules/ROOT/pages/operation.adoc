== Operation

=== Starting the Plugin

1. Ensure mayara-server is running and connected to your radar
2. Click the MaYaRa toolbar button or enable via *Options* → *Plugins*
3. The plugin will automatically discover connected radars

=== Toolbar Icon States

The toolbar icon color indicates connection status:

* *Gray* - No connection to mayara-server
* *Yellow* - Connected, radar in standby mode
* *Green* - Connected, radar transmitting

=== Chart Overlay Mode

When enabled, the radar overlay displays directly on your chart:

* Radar data is positioned relative to your vessel
* Overlay respects chart rotation (head-up, north-up, course-up)
* Transparency allows chart details to remain visible
* Range rings show distance

==== Overlay Behavior

* The overlay scales automatically with chart zoom
* Radar center follows your GPS position
* Heading line points in direction of travel
* Returns are color-coded by intensity

=== PPI Window Mode

The separate PPI (Plan Position Indicator) window provides a traditional
radar display:

==== Opening the PPI Window

1. Enable "Show PPI Window" in preferences, or
2. Right-click the toolbar icon and select "Show PPI Window"

==== PPI Controls

* *Mouse Wheel* - Zoom in/out
* *Left Click* - Acquire ARPA target at that position
* *Keyboard +/-* - Zoom in/out
* *Keyboard 0* - Reset zoom

==== PPI Display Elements

* *Range Rings* - Concentric circles at regular intervals
* *Heading Line* - Yellow line pointing forward
* *ARPA Targets* - Red triangles with velocity vectors

=== Both Modes Together

You can use both chart overlay and PPI window simultaneously:

* Chart overlay for navigation context
* PPI window for detailed radar analysis

=== Radar Discovery

The plugin automatically discovers radars connected to mayara-server:

* New radars are detected within the discovery interval (default 10 seconds)
* Disconnected radars are removed from the display
* Multiple radars can be displayed simultaneously
