your radar model but typically include:

* Short range: 125m, 250m, 500m, 750m, 1000m

=== Gain Control

Adjusts the receiver sensitivity.

Higher gain shows weaker returns but may increase noise.
Lower gain reduces clutter but may miss weak targets.

* *Manual* - Use the slider to set rejection level (0-100%)

Increase for rough seas, decrease in calm conditions.

Reduces interference from precipitation.

* Use the slider to set rejection level (0-100%)

Increase during rain, decrease in clear weather.
